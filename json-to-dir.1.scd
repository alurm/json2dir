json-to-dir(1)

# NAME

json-to-dir â€” a tool to convert JSON to a directory

# SYNOPSIS

*json2-dir* < file.json_

# DESCRIPTION

The json-to-dir tool recursively converts a JSON object given to stdin to a directory structure.

Files and directories will be made in the directory where the tool is launched.

Object keys map to directory names. String values map to file contents.

# BUGS

Currently, symlinks can't be represented and files' contents must be valid JSON strings.

# EXAMPLES

```
printf '%s' '{
  "file": "Hello, world!\n",
  "dir": {
    "subfile": "Content.\n",
    "subdir": {}
  }
}' | json-to-dir
```
